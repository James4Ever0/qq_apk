<p>Thanks for using the Contacts function (Will be referred to as "The Function")!</p>

<p>Please carefully read the following rules before using The Function (Will be referred to as "The Rules"):</p>

<p>1. Enable Function:ã€€You can enable The Function through the following steps, depending on specific product settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Bind to mobile phone number: You need to bind your QQ number to your mobile phone number. To ensure information security, The Function will automatically send a verification code SMS to your mobile phone (The expense of this SMS is paid for by Tencent). After receiving the SMS, fill in accordingly;</li>

<li>(2) Upload mobile phone code: After encrypting mobile phone numbers of your Contacts through high-strength algorithms, upload the corresponding code to the server client of The Function;</li>

<li>(3) Mobile phone code match: Match your code with the feature code of the mobile phone number that has been bound to a QQ number;</li>

<li>(4) Recommend user: Recommends the QQ user that is matched to the mobile phone's code;</li>
<li>(5) Discussion group function: After you enable The Function, you may be added to a discussion group by other QQ users that have also enabled the Function.

For example, your QQ number can be viewed by other QQ users of the discussion group and you can choose to exit the discussion group yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Tencent may, during the steps of binding a mobile phone number, recommend the mobile phone number information that you have submitted to Tencent service, so as to facilitate your use of the Service. The above-mentioned information won't be displayed or provided to other users.</p>

<p>3. After you enable the Function, a friend that has also enabled the Function can find you through the Function.</p>

In the meantime, you can invoke the corresponding interface of Contacts through the Function, so as to facilitate such operations as sending SMS and making calls. All services of your operations such as sending SMS and making calls are provided by corresponding operators and you shall bear the corresponding costs.</p>

<p>6. After enabling the Function, you can disable it at the relevant interface. After you disable the Function, no one can add you as a Friend with the Function. If you need to use the Function later, you can enable it again.</p>
